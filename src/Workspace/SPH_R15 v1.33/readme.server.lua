-- How to install SPH:
-- 1. Move everything over to its designated folder.
-- 2. Reupload the animations under "Reupload these animations" by right-clicking each animation and clicking "Save to Roblox."
-- Please do not place these animations on a Roblox default rig, as they were built on a Spearhead rig and adjusting them to a new rig will cause issues.
-- Make sure to save animations to whichever source is most convenient, e.g. if you are setting up a US Army group, be sure to upload to
-- (your US Army) instead of to "Me"
-- 3. Copy the asset IDs from each animation and set the AnimationID in SPH_Assets -> Animations to that ID. 
-- If you upload "AK_Chamber R15", go to SPH_Assets -> Animations and set AK_Chamber's AnimationID to the asset ID given by the upload. When you upload animations
-- you will get an opportunity to copy the asset ID, simplifying this process.
-- You can also use animation spoofers like "Animation Spoofer" by KyleThornton to directly copy animations from SPH_Assets->Animations, but do whatever works for you.
-- 4. Have fun!

-- How to install SPH Grenades (R15 & R6 compatible)
-- 1. Upload the animations under "Reupload these Animations" in GrenadeAnims_R15 (or GrenadeAnims if you're using R6)
-- Make sure to save animations to whichever source is most convenient, e.g. if you are setting up a US Army group, be sure to upload to
-- (your US Army) instead of to "Me"
-- 3. Copy the asset IDs from each animation and set the AnimationIDs in "High," "Low", "Med" and "Idle" to that ID in each grenade tool.
